        <p align="justify">I am a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience working with Peter Dayan at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. I study how skills and heuristics are learned and used to make complex planning problems more feasible to solve.</p>
        <p align="justify">This spring-summer, I am working in the Neurolab at Deepmind. Check out this <a href="kevinmiller.org/neuroscience-at-google-deepmind">cool stack of papers</a> from the team that I plan to add to.</p>
        <p align="justify"> Usually, I am wearing a cognitive scientist hat and I am also wearing a small artificial intelligence hat under it. I probe human behavior in gamified tasks and puzzles and I develop algorithms that serve as models human cognition as well as machine learning tools. Feel free to read more about my Projects.</p>
        <p align="justify"> One time, I also had to put on the whistleblower hat. It was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. I chose not to write about the experience in length because the person resigned with almost immediate effect and I wish to minimize the damage. But I learned hard and important lessons about dealing with abuse of power in Eastern Europe which, currently, is a very different story from how it occurs and gets handled in the West. I mention this to offer support to anyone finding themselves in the same boat. You are not alone -- and do reach out for help if you need it.</p>
        <p align="justify">And back to a lighter note. If you ever need to stop me rambling about science, bring up one of these topics: cinema (and my one-sentence movie reviews), cappuccino, perfume, taekwondo, calisthenics, sauna \& cold dips, longevity, diving, or rats. It works every time.

        <h3 class="push-down-3"><span>Things that seem true to me right now that didn't use to; from big things to mundane ones</span></h3>

        <ul id="opinions">
          <li align="justify">
            This has been written down thousands of times already and here I am writing it down too because I didn't quite believe it when I was young: persistence wins over talent. Talent gives you a headstart and speed advantage for sure. But persistence ultimately wins the game every time.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            The conservation of energy applies to matter and the conservation of worry applies to minds. I've seen people in extreme poverty and extreme wealth worry the same amount but about different things. The luxury that money gave me is that now I can choose what to worry about.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Habits and routines are not for eveyone. 'Healthy routines' enable productivity for some and stifle it for others. I was searching for the best routine only to realize I'm happiest when I don't stick to one.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            There are as many types of mindfulness as many types of people. For me, challenge is the best inducer of mindfulness.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            The approach-avoidance conflict. We are hard-wired to approach things that we want and avoid things that we don't want. It's difficult to learn to do the opposite. For rats, it's almost impossible to learn to avoid a food dispenser in order to ultimately get food; or to learn to approach a shock port in order to not get shocked. Humans are somewhat flexible. You have to learn to approach when you would rather avoid someone that needs soothing. You have to learn to avoid when you would rather approach someone that needs space.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            You need quantity over quality for learning something new; and quality over quantity for mastering it. Don't ponder too long what lesson or project to start with -- just start.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Appreciate the time that you can spend on learning theory. Don't ask too soon 'How is this useful?'. First, understand 'What can be useful?'. Theory expands your mind. You'll have a lot of time for practice later.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Yes, industry does value a PhD. It's due to the saliency bias that we over-represent people that state otherwise.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Forgiveness is validation. Forgiving mistakes helped me a lot. And not forgiving deliberate actions also helped me a lot.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Cities, like people, are deceiving to the naive. For me, Budapest was the long-term first love that ultimately wasn't meant to be; New York was a f***-boy with good intentions but little self-awareness; Sydney was a quick fling that keeps me wondering if it could have been something more; and Tübingen was the nice guy that doesn't even mind being called nice and I wish I appreciated more from the beginning.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            It is fine to sleep for 9 hours every night.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Academics tend to forget this but there is no real tradeoff between exterior and interior. There is wisdom in beauty and beauty in wisdom.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            If you want real luxury, learn how to cook, mix drinks, and do your skin and hair care at home. No one else knows your tastes and needs as well as you do.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            If I wash the front pieces of my hair in the sink with a dab of shampoo, dry it and put everything up in a ponytail, I can fool even myself into thinking I have fresh hair.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            People asked me about how I travel with a carry-on backpack only 99% of the time. The one real hack I use: wool tops -- tank tops, t-shirts and sweaters. Cashmere since I started earning more. I can rewear them for days and often weeks because they wick moisture during the day and get refreshed overnight. May not be for everyone.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            Stainless steel is the only material in the kitchen that is both durable and nonreactive. All of my best pans, pots, bowls, strainers, whisks, cups, lemon squeezers are stainless steel.
